# Sneak-Peek
Basic API calling and data binding in Windows Universal Platform

Here's the guide that I wrote myself to go with this code


#API used
In this tutorial we will be using API from [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en), you will probably need your own API_Key from this site. Please go ahead and sign up.
Full documentation for TMDb API can be found [here](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/)

#Tools recommended
Tools such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) chrome extension and [json2charp](http://json2csharp.com/) are highly recommended.
